thats the problem with you guys not responding to your emails bc HE WAS RESPONDING to his emails, that's the fking problen with all of that

but i didnt care what he said

he wrote that email first thing in the morning, like he was in a hurry to write that email, fking moron

did it work? NO. did i stop writing to you? no i didnt. did i stop re-applying? no i didnt. he's a fking loser, there's a special place in hell for ppl like this u and i both know that. hes absolute trash in academia.

this is an incredibly, incredibly weak person, its like hes made out of 1-ply toilet paper thats already soaking wet, he could not handle a resignation from his shit hole, thats so crazy, what a crazy fking person
